    <h1>Extra Information</h1>
    <p>Popping boba is made using reverse spherification, a technique where flavored liquid mixed with sodium alginate is dropped into a calcium lactate/water bath. 
        The chemical reaction creates a thin, gel-like membrane around the liquid.
         Essential ingredients include fruit juice (avoiding high calcium/citric acid), sodium alginate, and calcium lactate, formed using a syringe or dropper. </p>

    <span>Prepare the Juice Mixture: Blend 
 cup of juice or tea with 
 tsp of sodium alginate. Add sweetener if necessary, then let the mixture sit for 1-2 hours (or overnight) in the refrigerator to remove air bubbles.
Prepare the Setting Bath: Dissolve 2 tsp of calcium lactate in 2 cups of water.
Form the Spheres: Using a syringe, dropper, or pipette, slowly drop the juice mixture into the calcium bath. The droplets will immediately form small pearls.
Set and Rinse: Let the pearls sit in the bath for about 40 seconds to 1 minute. Scoop them out with a slotted spoon and rinse them gently in a bowl of fresh water.
Serve: Enjoy immediately, as they are best within 15 minutes to 12 hours. </span>
